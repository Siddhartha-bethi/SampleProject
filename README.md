## Steps to start a MERN Project:

1) npm init
2) npm i express
3) create backend folder
4) (for frontend) npx create-react-app frontend
5) cd frontend 
          -> npm start
          ->(for production-->frontend and backend runs together) npm run build
6) create index.js
7) update package.json-> name of js and in scripts "start": "node name.js".
8) npm start in main folder and install all necessities
9) create db, lib, utils folders in backend
10) create config.js
11) create connection.js in backend/db
12) create allRoutes.js in backend/routes
13) create logger.js in backend/utils (note add logger.js path in connection.js)
14) remove and add our code in frontend/src/app.js
15) create component folder in frontend/src and create homepage.js in component folder.
16) Add proxy to frontend/package.json

- Copy the contents of id_ed25519.pub file.
- In your [Github Account settings ](https://github.com/settings/profile), click on “SSH and GPG Keys”. 
- On the [SSH and GPG Keys page ](https://github.com/settings/keys), click on “New SSH key”. Give an easy to understand title and paste the contents of the “id_ed25519.pub” file in the Key section. Click “Add SSH Key”.

**NOTE:**

## Coding Guidelines

- Have comments in your code. Comments should be brief and concise to explain what is being done.
- Abstraction for DB and API connections.
- Function names should be self explanatory.
- Don’t create too many functions.
- Exception handling at every external connection or possibility of failure
- Assume every external call will fail and handle it accordingly. API/DB (Exceptions as well as logic should be built to deal with connection failures).
- Log information instead of just dumping exceptions. In case of exception, give some error message (should include the function and class name which has failed) along with the exception.
- Support log levels. Logging should support log levels of INFO, ERROR and DEBUG with the ability to enable/disable each level from the config file. (DEBUG should include detailed contents of all the activity and its data in each step).
- Do not put sensitive information (password, keys, etc.) in logs.
- Standardized spacing in the code and format the code properly before making a PR.
- Do not store credentials/keys in code. Keep them in configurable environments.
- Don’t hardcode values in the code. Instead use variables. For example: Timeouts/keepalives, Values of external sites data 
- Reduce DB calls. Wherever possible cache data, optimize logic to reduce DB calls.
